# Data-analysis-of-Renewable-energy using PowerBI

This project uses PowerBI to analyze and visualize detailed information about various renewable energy systems. The dataset includes data on installed capacity, energy production, consumption, storage, investment, and environmental impact.

ðŸ”— Link to the dataset - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/girumwondemagegn/dataset-for-renewable-energy-systems)


## Overview
This dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview for useful research and analysis. It includes various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and analyses such as:

* Energy Consumption: Analyzes the distribution of energy consumption across different types of renewable energy (e.g., Solar, Hydroelectric, Biomass) using a donut chart, though it does not directly show investments or incentives achieved.
* Total Jobs: Displays the impact of renewable energy on employment through a pie chart showing total jobs created by renewable energy type (e.g., Wind, Hydroelectric, Solar), with segments like 5M (13.85%) and 6M (14.73%).
* Storage Efficiency & ROI: Measures storage efficiency with an "Average of Storage to Production Ratio" (6.45), though ROI is not explicitly shown in the dashboard.
* Pollution Index: Evaluates the environmental impact through an "Air Pollution n-Index" and "Capacity Factor n-Index" in the table, providing metrics like 66.38 and 0.03 for Biomass under different grid integration levels.
* Capacity Analysis: Compares the difference between minimum and average installed capacities for grid integration levels using a bar chart, with color coding for Increase (green), Decrease (red), and Total (blue).
* Conditionally Formatted Data View: Provides a tabular view of data with conditional formatting to highlight key values, such as grid integration levels and associated metrics, though specific formatting (e.g., color scales) is not visible in the screenshot.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the installation instructions and explore the various dashboards and analyses available.

### Installation and Usage
* Clone the repository
* After I have taken the dataset from kaggle, I cleaned it and added the text columns for Type of renewable energy, Grid integration level and Funding sources
* Launch PowerBI Desktop and open the .pbix file located in the repository
* Explore the dashboard and modify it according to your liking

This is how the overall powerbi report will look like:
